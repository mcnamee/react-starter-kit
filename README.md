## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

This project was bootstrapped with the [React Boilerplate Builder](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-boilerplate-builder) by [Matt McNamee](https://mcnam.ee).

- __Flux architecture__
    - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
    - Redux Wrapper: [Rematch](https://github.com/rematch/rematch)
- __Routing and navigation__
    - [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for web
- __Data Caching / Offline__
    - [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
- __UI Toolkit__
    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for web
- __Code Linting__ with
    - [Airbnb's JS Linting](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) guidelines
