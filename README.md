# MattsSickWeb - React Web App

---

## 👋 Intro

This project was bootstrapped with the [React Boilerplate Builder](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-boilerplate-builder) by [Matt McNamee](https://mcnam.ee).

The project is _super_ helpful to kick-start your next project, as it provides a lot of the common tools you may reach for, all ready to go. Specifically:

- __Flux architecture__
    - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
    - Redux Wrapper: [Rematch](https://github.com/rematch/rematch)
- __Routing and navigation__
    - [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for web
- __Data Caching / Offline__
    - [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
- __UI Toolkit__
    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for web
- __Code Linting__ with
    - [Airbnb's JS Linting](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) guidelines

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Install `eslint`, `prettier` and `editor config` plugins into your IDE

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run the app in the development mode
# Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
yarn start

# Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode
yarn test

# Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
# It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance
yarn run build

# Lint
./node_modules/.bin/eslint "src/**/*.js"
```
